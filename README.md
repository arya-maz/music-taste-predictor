# Music Recommendation App

A personal machine learning music recommendation project that builds a user taste profile from album ratings and uses predicted scores to vet and rank candidate albums before recommending them.


## Background

As a long-time avid music fanatic, I've always been eager to chase new experiences through different artists, genres, styles, and eras of music. Throughout 2025, I challenged myself to check out 365 albums that I had never heard before -- some of which were newer albums releasing on a rolling basis throughout the year, while the majority were either releases that I had missed from recent years or older records that I wanted to closely familiarize myself with. This experience inspired me to build a recommendation tool that would make finding new albums to experience much easier and more straightforward.

The goal of this project is to recommend albums to a user based on their personal taste. At this stage, I am building the taste-modeling foundation for that larger recommendation system. Score prediction is being used as a practical way to estimate how much a user may enjoy an album, which can later help determine which candidate albums should be recommended, filtered out, or ranked higher.

## Project Progress

### 1. Dataset Creation

The project started with a CSV file containing albums I listened to for the first time throughout 2025. Each entry included basic album information as well as my personal score.

The dataset includes:

- Artist
- Album title
- Release year
- Number of tracks
- Runtime in minutes
- Three genre tags
- Personal score out of 100

This step turned a casual listening challenge into a usable dataset for taste analysis, score prediction, and future album recommendation.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Project Setup

After creating the dataset, I cleaned the album data and organized the Python project structure. This created a foundation for loading the dataset, preparing features, training models, and generating repeatable outputs.

At this stage, the project moved from a spreadsheet-based idea into an actual machine learning workflow.

### 3. Baseline Taste Model Training

Once the data was prepared, I trained an initial machine learning model to predict album scores. The current baseline model uses CatBoost because it works well with categorical features such as artist names and genre tags.

The model predicts a numeric score out of 100 for each album. Since the dataset represents my personal taste, the model is designed to learn patterns in my own ratings rather than make general claims about music quality. These predicted scores are not the final product by themselves; they are intended to act as a recommendation signal that can help vet and rank albums the user has not listened to yet.

### 4. Model Error Reporting

After training the baseline model, I added a text-based error reporting system. Instead of only looking at a single score such as mean absolute error, the report shows where the model performs well and where it struggles.

The error report helps identify:

- Albums with the most accurate predictions
- Albums with the largest prediction errors
- Cases where the model overpredicts or underpredicts scores
- Differences in performance across low, mid, and high score ranges
- Whether specific tuning changes actually significantly improve the model or not

This made the project more practical because it gave me a clearer way to inspect model behavior instead of relying only on summary metrics. Since predicted scores will eventually be used to rank recommendation candidates, understanding when the model is reliable is an important part of the recommendation pipeline.

### 5. Score Tier Threshold Experiment

After reviewing the model reports, I adjusted the score thresholds used to group albums into low, mid, and high rating tiers. The original thresholds did not fully reflect the way my ratings were distributed across the dataset.

Changing the thresholds made the reports more meaningful because the model could be evaluated against score ranges that better matched my actual listening data.

### 6. Sample Weighting Experiment

I also tested sample weighting to see whether the model could better learn from albums in less common score ranges. The idea was to give certain albums more influence during training, especially ratings that were farther away from the most common score range.

After comparing the new error reports, I reverted the model back to the original unweighted baseline. The weighted version changed the model's behavior, but it did not clearly improve the predictions enough to justify keeping it.

This experiment was still useful because it showed that model tuning should be evaluated carefully. A more complex training setup is not automatically better if the resulting predictions are less stable or less useful.

### 7. AOTY Dataset Expansion

After building the original model around the 2025 listening dataset, I expanded the project by exporting my all-time Album of the Year ratings (albumoftheyear.org, aoty.org). This gave the project a much larger dataset that better represents my long-term music taste across more albums, artists, eras, and rating ranges. I did this with the objective of using the specific, detailed, and precise data collection from my smaller, 365-column dataset, with my extensive all-time data of nearly 1200 albums for a sharper prediction algorithm.

The AOTY export included:

- Artist
- Album title
- Release year
- Format
- Personal score
- Date rated

I decided to neglect the date rated column as it has virtually zero impact on this experiment, removing it from the cleaned modeling dataset. I also kept the original artist field intact instead of adding complicated multi-artist parsing, since there were only a small number of multi-artist cases and overengineering that step could create unnecessary errors. I was originally considering splitting artist names at '&' or ',' but this would have resuted in names of singular artists such as "Tyler, The Creator" to become split, causing errors.

This created a larger AOTY-based ratings dataset that could be compared against the smaller but cleaner 2025 dataset.

### 8. Last.fm Metadata Enrichment

The AOTY export was useful because it provided many more ratings, but it lacked the album-level descriptive features that made the original 2025 dataset valuable. Since AOTY does not have an API, I used Last.fm as a source for certain album attributes.

The enrichment script uses the Last.fm API to add:

- Genre 1
- Genre 2
- Genre 3
- Number of tracks
- Runtime

The genre tags required additional filtering because Last.fm tags can include non-genre labels such as years, artist names, list tags, or other user-uploaded filler, such as "2006" or "mid". To address this, I added a controlled filtering system that removes obvious junk tags while allowing specific genre names such as "hip-hop" or "alternative pop". To catch other genres that may slip through the cracks, I also implemented a list of common prefix/suffixes that appear in more niche genre names -- "gaze", "core", or "wave" to catch a genre such as "Darkwave" that may be missing from the original list.

The enriched AOTY CSV is formatted to mimic the same column order as the original 2025 dataset:

- Artist
- Album
- Year
- Number of tracks
- Runtime
- Genre 1
- Genre 2
- Genre 3
- Score

Additional tracking columns are kept after those main modeling columns so the dataset remains readable while still preserving metadata about where the enriched values came from.

The most recent enrichment pass produced strong metadata coverage, with most albums receiving track count and runtime information and a majority of albums receiving usable genre tags.

### 9. Enriched AOTY Model Experiment

After creating the enriched AOTY dataset, I trained a new model using the expanded feature set. This model used artist, format, release year, release decade, genre tags, number of tracks, and runtime to predict album scores.

The enriched model beat the dummy baseline, but it did not outperform the earlier basic AOTY model. This suggests that the additional Last.fm-derived features may introduce noise, sparse categories, or inconsistent metadata that the current model does not yet handle well.

This result is still useful because it shows that adding more features is not automatically an improvement. The next step is to run feature ablation experiments to identify which parts of the enriched dataset help prediction and which parts may hurt it.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the expanded dataset evaluation stage.

Completed so far:

- Created the 2025 album listening dataset
- Cleaned and structured the original dataset
- Set up the Python project workflow
- Trained an initial CatBoost taste prediction model
- Added text-based model error reports
- Evaluated prediction behavior across score tiers
- Adjusted score tier thresholds
- Tested sample weighting
- Reverted back to the original unweighted baseline model
- Exported all-time AOTY ratings into a larger CSV dataset
- Built an AOTY cleaning script
- Removed non-album-level date-rated features from the AOTY data
- Used Last.fm to enrich the AOTY dataset with genre tags
- Added filtering logic to reduce noisy Last.fm tags
- Used Last.fm album metadata to add runtime and track count information
- Reformatted the enriched AOTY CSV to match the original 2025 dataset's column order
- Trained a model on the enriched AOTY dataset
- Compared the enriched AOTY model against the dummy baseline and earlier AOTY model

The current finding is that the enriched AOTY model beats the dummy baseline but does not yet outperform the earlier basic AOTY model. This means the larger enriched dataset is promising, but the added features need more careful analysis before being treated as a clear improvement.

The next step is to run ablation experiments to compare basic AOTY features, genre features, metadata features, and combined feature sets. This will help determine whether genre tags, runtime, track count, or other engineered features are actually improving prediction quality.
